No re-embedding or re-chunking needed.\n\n## Sync integration\n\nIn compute_sync_plan(), after building to_delete and to_ingest lists, cross-reference them: if a deletion candidate and an ingestion candidate share the same size+mtime, treat it as a rename instead of delete+ingest. mv preserves both attributes on the same filesystem.\n\nSyncPlan gains a to_rename list of (old_record, new_path) tuples. sync_collection handles renames via rename_document() + registry update.\n\nAmbiguous case (multiple files with identical size+mtime): fall back to delete+ingest.\n\n## Three layers to update\n\n1.
