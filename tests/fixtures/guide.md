# Machine Learning

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. Supervised learning algorithms train on labeled datasets, mapping inputs to known outputs through techniques like linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses multi-layered neural networks to extract hierarchical features from raw data, achieving state-of-the-art results in image recognition, natural language processing, and speech synthesis.

# Database Systems

Database systems provide structured storage, retrieval, and management of data. Relational databases like PostgreSQL and MySQL organize data into tables with rows and columns, enforcing data integrity through schemas, constraints, and ACID transactions. SQL (Structured Query Language) serves as the standard interface for querying relational databases, supporting operations like SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY. NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra offer flexible schemas and horizontal scalability for applications that require high throughput and low latency.

# Network Security

Network security encompasses the policies, practices, and technologies designed to protect computer networks from unauthorized access, misuse, and attacks. Firewalls filter network traffic based on predefined rules, while intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor for suspicious activity patterns. Encryption protocols like TLS secure data in transit, and virtual private networks (VPNs) create encrypted tunnels for remote access. Common attack vectors include phishing, denial-of-service (DoS), man-in-the-middle attacks, and SQL injection, each requiring specific defensive countermeasures.
